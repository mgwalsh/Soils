# Introduction

Soil acidity can be thought of as occurring in two forms: active or soil solution acidity as measured by pH in water, and *"reserve acidity"*. The reserve (or exchangeable) acidity, as measured by Hp (meq $H^+$/ 100 g soil), is held on soil colloids controls the overall level of soluble or active acidity in the soil solution, and is generally many times higher than the active acidity. Hp levels depend on several properties such as the amount and type of clay ([mineralogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralogy)), the amount of organic matter, and the soluble Al, Ca, Mg, K and Na concentrations of the soil. Thus, two soils may have the same soil pH but completely different lime requirements. To effectively raise the soil pH over the long-term, both the active and reserve acidity must be neutralized. Soil test labs typically determine the buffering capacity and the lime requirement by measuring or estimating reserve acidity; see e.g., the excellent introductory tutorial in [Moorberg & Crouse (v.2)](https://kstatelibraries.pressbooks.pub/soilslabmanual/chapter/soil-acidity-and-adjusting-soil-ph/).

Spectral signatures of soils, and materials generally, are defined by their reflectance or absorbance as a function of wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum. Under controlled conditions, the signatures result from electronic transitions of atoms and vibrational stretching and bending of structural groups of atoms that form molecules or crystals. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy has been shown to provide highly repeatable, rapid and low cost measurements of many different soil properties in numerous studies. The amount of light absorbed by a soil sample is measured with minimal sample preparation across a wide range of wavelengths to provide a unique spectral signature. A measurement can be performed in about 30 seconds, in contrast to conventional soil tests, which are typically slow, labor-intensive, expensive and may use harmful chemicals.

This notebook does not go into the details of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy) itself, but instead it focuses on the **spectrometry**, that is the steps that are needed to generate useful predictions from a population of spectral signatures (features) relative to reference measurements (labels). In this particlar example, I shall use topsoil (0-20 cm) and subsoil (20-50 cm) data that were sampled as part of the AfSIS project which sampled the major [KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate zones](http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/) of Africa excluding deserts, urban and other non-photosynthetically active land areas.

I'll be using a machine learning approach, which is largely *algorithmic*, rather than *data modeling* based. You might want to take a look at [Breiman (2001)](http://staff.pubhealth.ku.dk/~tag/Teaching/share/material/Breiman-two-cultures.pdf) to gauge the differences between the *"two cultures"* he describes. The figure above shows the basic workflow of the algorithmic approach that I apply here to predicting reserve acidity (Hp) as an example. The main motivation for using Hp in this example is that AfSIS is currently involved in several new, large-area projects that are focusing on acid soil management and cropland lime requirements. The other operational management aspect of this is that acidity problems should probably be addressed/fixed first, in the areas where they occur, and before attempting to solve e.g., fertilizer input and/or other soil related, agronomic management issues.

# General data setup

To actually run the notebook, you will need to load the packages indicated in the chunk directly below. This allows you to assemble the wet chemistry and spectral dataframes providing a lot of options to generate spectral predictions of acidity relevant soil properties such as pH, EC, Hp, eCEC Ca:Mg, among others. The notebook itself is maintained on my [Github](https://github.com/mgwalsh/Soils/blob/master/Spec_acidity_preds.Rmd), and you can fork and modify it from there as you see fit.

```{r}
# package names
packages <- c("downloader", "caret", "caretEnsemble", "MASS", "pls", "glmnet", "randomForest", "gbm", "nnet", "Cubist", "leaflet", "htmlwidgets", "plyr", "doParallel")

# install packages
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

# load packages
invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

The next chunk downloads the data needed for running this particular example. It assembles georeferenced soil measurements collected across Africa by the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project and links these to [Bruker Alpha FT-IR](https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/infrared-and-raman/ft-ir-routine-spectrometer/alpha-ii-compact-ft-ir-spectrometer.html) spectra. Note that this chunk is Mac or Linux specific and so the directory structures would need to be changed slightly to run on Windows machines.

```{r}
# Create a data folder in your current working directory
dir.create("soil_acidity", showWarnings = F)
setwd("./soil_acidity")
dir.create("Results", showWarnings = F)

# Data download
download("https://osf.io/f4dpw/?raw=1", "acidity_data.zip", mode="wb")
unzip("acidity_data.zip", overwrite = T)
prof <- read.table("profiles.csv", header=T, sep=",") ## sample locations and depths
cnls <- read.table("cnls.csv", header=T, sep=",") ## wet chemistry data from CNLS, Nairobi
cnls$eCEC <- cnls$m3Ca/200+cnls$m3Mg/120+cnls$m3K/390+cnls$m3Na/230 ## calculates eCEC  
text <- read.table("text.csv", header=T, sep=",") ## AfSIS LDPSA soil texture
oxid <- read.table("oxid.csv", header=T, sep=",") ## AfSIS XRF metal oxide data
spec <- read.table("alpha_spec.csv", header=T, sep=",") ## AfSIS spectral absorbance data
  
# Merge the wet chemistry reference dataframes
adata <- merge(prof, cnls, by = "ssid")
adata <- merge(adata, text, by = "ssid")
adata <- merge(adata, oxid, by = "ssid")

# Randomize dataframe
set.seed(1235813)
adata <- adata[sample(1:nrow(adata)), ]

# Download figures
download("https://osf.io/42gry/", "figures.zip", mode = "wb")
exdir <- "./Figures" 
unzip("figures.zip", exdir = exdir, overwrite = T)
```

The following chunk then writes out the dataframe `AfSIS_reference_data.csv` into your `./soil_acidity/Results` directory if you'd like to process those outputs in software other than R. It also generates a location map of where those soil samples were obtained.

```{r}
# Write data frame
write.csv(adata, "./soil_acidity/Results/AfSIS_reference_data.csv", row.names = F)

# Soil sample locations
w <- leaflet() %>%
  setView(lng = mean(adata$lon), lat = mean(adata$lat), zoom = 3) %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap.Mapnik) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(adata$lon, adata$lat, clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
w ## plot widget 
```

# Spectral feature conversions

One potentially problematic factor for many MLAs is the [Curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) that is imposed by the high dimensionality of the spectral data: w = 2,541 individual wavebands in this particular case. Moreover, many of those wavebands are strongly collinear (correlated), particularly those proximal to one another on the spectrum. These types of data pose generalization and prediction challenges for MLAs such as [Random forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) and [Neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network). Other algorithms such as [Partial least squares regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression), [Ridge regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression) and/or [Lasso regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lasso_(statistics) handle the high dimensional data and collinearities well in a linear context but are frequently not very good at predicting common non-linear and/or threshold relationships between the spectral signatures and their reference measurements.

There are some ways of mitigating these tradeoffs. The first is to reduce the dimensionality and collinearity of the spectral data. There are a number of techniques that can be applied in that context including: [Principal components analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), [Independent components analysis (ICA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis) as well as other signal processing techniques such as [Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-negative_matrix_factorization). I use PCA here, and the next chunk appends the spectra and their resulting spectral component scores to the wet chemistry reference data.

```{r}
# Spectral principal components
spec.pca <- prcomp(spec[,2:2542], center=T, scale=T)
pcas <- predict(spec.pca, spec)
pcas <- pcas[,1:20] ## save the first 20 components, which explain ~95% of the total spectral variance

# Merge & write files
spec <- cbind(spec, pcas)
adata <- merge(adata, spec, by = "ssid")
write.csv(adata, "./soil_acidity/Results/AfSIS_acidity_data.csv", row.names=F)
```

The other main option is of course to run both types of algorithms (data regularization and data reduction based) and then look at if they can be usefully combined. This is the approach that I will take here.

# Spectral predictions with machine-learning

The following chunks predict soil Hp values using different machine learning algorithms (MLAs) with MIR spectral (feature) inputs using both the [`caretEnsemble`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caretEnsemble/index.html) and [`caret`](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) packages. This general approach has won a lot of data science competitions e.g., at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You may want to take a look there. They have some fantastic data science resources, courses and challenges openly available. You can also check out the AfSIS sponsored [Africa Soil Property Prediction Challenge (2014)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties/overview/timeline), from which the approach that is presented here was developed.

The main idea is to train a number of potentially competing models with [k-fold cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)). At the end of the model training processes, the various models are ensembled (combined/stacked) on an *independent* validation dataset. When applied consistently over time and space, this is a form of [Reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning), which should produce increasingly accurate predictions as new field, lab data and MLAs are obtained and run. The following chunk initially scrubs some of the extraneous objects in memory, sets-up labels and features, and creates a randomized partition between the training and validation dataframes. 

```{r}
rm(list=setdiff(ls(), c("adata"))) ## scrubs extraneous objects in memory

# Set randomization seed
seed <- 1235813
set.seed(seed)

# Split data into calibration and validation sets
gsIndex <- createDataPartition(adata$Hp, p = 8/10, list=F, times = 1)
cal <- adata[ gsIndex,]
val <- adata[-gsIndex,]

# Set calibration labels
labs <- c("Hp") ## insert other labels (pH, EC, eCEC, ...) here!
lcal <- as.vector(t(cal[labs]))

# Spectral calibration features
fcal <- cal[,26:2566] ## full Alpha FT-IR spectral signatures
pcal <- cal[,2567:2586] ## spectral principal components
```

All of the subsequent model fitting processes are parallelized to facilitate efficient use of either local or cloud-based computing resources. Note that there are other options available for this e.g., the [`snowfall`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snowfall/snowfall.pdf) package, among others.
